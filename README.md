# SnakeGame



A SnakeGame is a classic video game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen.The objective is to collect food items,which makes the snake grow longer.The game is usually set in a bounded area, and the snake must avoid running into the walls or into itself.The player uses arrow keys or other controls to direct the snake's movement.As the snake grows longer,the game becomes more challenging because avoiding collisions becomes increasingly difficult.The game typically keeps track of the player's score,which increase with each food item collected,and the game ends when the snake collides with a wall or list. Snake games are simple yet addictive and have been a popular genre in the history of video games.
